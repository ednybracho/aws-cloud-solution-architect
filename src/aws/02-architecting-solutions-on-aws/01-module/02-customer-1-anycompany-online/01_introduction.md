# Introduction

Throughout this course, we will include readings like this one that link to resources to help you further your learning with AWS. Depending on your experience level, you might be looking for deeper information or hands-on tutorials on AWS. These readings will help point you to resources where you can explore topics that are relevant to your own learning in more detail.

## Architecting Solutions on AWS

This course explores architecting solutions on AWS in the context of four unique scenarios. Each week, you will be presented with a customer use case. You will then view videos that design a solution to meet the customer’s needs, step by step. This process will result in an AWS architecture diagram at the end of each week. If you want to follow along and also design the AWS architectures, you can use various tools to build your diagram. To view drawing and diagramming tools, see [AWS Architecture Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/) and scroll down to the drawing and diagramming tools section. This course doesn’t include videos about building a proof of concept for each design, though it does include instructions on how to build a proof of concept for week 1 and week 2. These instructions can be followed in your own personal AWS account. This course also offers exploratory demos for many of the services that are covered, and some tutorials will be embedded or linked to in the readings.

## Hands-on exercises and tutorials

Any hands-on tutorials or exercises that are included in this course—or linked to from this course—will require you to have an AWS account. To create an AWS account, follow the instructions in [How do I create and activate an AWS account?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)

## AWS Free Tier

With the AWS Free Tier, customers can explore and try out AWS services free of charge, up to specified limits for each service. The AWS Free Tier comprises three different types of offerings: 12 months free, always free, and short-term trials. Customers can use services with a 12-months-free offer to use the product for free—up to specified limits—for 1 year, starting from the date that the account was activated. Customers can use services with an always-free offer to use the product for free up (again, up to specified limits) as long as they are an AWS customer. Services with a short-term trial are free to use for a specified period of time, or up to a one-time limit, depending on the service that’s selected. You can see details about the limits and services that are provided for free on each card on the AWS Free Tier page. If your application use exceeds the AWS Free Tier limits, you pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates (for full pricing details, see the main webpage for the service). For more information about the AWS Free Tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all).

## AWS Architecture Center

The AWS Architecture Center provides reference architecture diagrams, vetted architecture solutions, Well-Architected best practices, patterns, icons, and more. This expert guidance was contributed by cloud architecture experts from AWS (including solutions architects and professional services consultants) and AWS Partners. For examples from the AWS Architecture Center, see [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/?cards-all.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&cards-all.sort-order=desc&awsf.content-type=*all&awsf.methodology=*all&awsf.tech-category=*all&awsf.industries=*all).

## AWS Well-Architected Framework

In this course, we will optimize a sample architecture at the end of every week. As a solutions architect or cloud consultant, you might be asked to perform an AWS Well-Architected review in the future. For more information about the AWS Well-Architected Framework, see [AWS Well-Architected Framework.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)
