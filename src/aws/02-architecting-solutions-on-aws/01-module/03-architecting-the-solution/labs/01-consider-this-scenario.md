# Consider this Scenario

You are a solutions architect who is working with a customer, a startup travel company, to design solutions on AWS to meet their business needs. The startup has a travel website that helps users search for deals on flights and hotels based on data that the user inputs on the website. Currently, the code for the startupâ€™s application has been written and they want to host a web backend for one of their APIs, which is used for making queries against their data. This web backend must accept requests from external clients that make HTTPS calls. The clients will make GET requests from the frontend. These requests will require complex Structured Query Language (SQL) queries against the data. The customer plans to use a relational database, such as MySQL, to store this data. This customer also wants to use serverless technologies when possible. Write a few paragraphs that answer the following questions:

-   What components are needed to host a web backend on AWS? (For example: compute service, database service, or others. )
-   What AWS services would you consider using to build this solution?
-   What follow-up questions would you ask this customer to get more information about their requirements so that you could better determine which services to choose?
