# Discussion - Self Reflection

Consider this scenario: You have deployed an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance into a subnet in a virtual private cloud (VPC). This EC2 instance must be accessible from the internet. What steps must you take to enable internet traffic to flow to and from the instance? Assume the following conditions:

-   The VPC currently doesn’t have any internet gateways attached to it.
-   The subnet doesn’t have any custom route table associations.
-   Security groups and network access control lists (network ACLs) don’t have any rules that enable these connections.

Write a few sentences that describe the difference between network ACLs and security groups.
